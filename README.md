# Langrisser II Translation Tools

These files were left in my keeping by Commander Stab of Hiryuu Honnyaku.
The programs and source code contained within were written by alamone of
Warui Toransu who released his tools without a license.

I've been hanging onto these files for 14 years and am increasingly worried
that they may be lost to disk damage or poor sorting. Therefore I am posting
them to my Github account.

As far as I know there is no applicable license for this material. If one of
the original authors would like to grant permission to release the tools and
scripts under a Free Software license, I will update the repository's
information accordingly.

The tools depend on a file called LUNGRIS2.BIN which should have an MD5sum of
3de30d43a6433e91429535c3496f07da. This is a non-interleaved, non-headered
ROM that is 2,097,152 bytes in length.

The tools will generate a NEW.BIN containing the English script.

Scripts are stored in EUC encoded Japanese text and named with matching
"*E.EUC" or "*J.EUC" extensions to identify whether they contain original
Japanese text or English translation.

The *_fon.rar files are a series of alternate fonts that can be patched into
the game by uncompressing them in the main folder.
